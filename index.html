        <h3 id="head">Here's a time line of Issac Newton life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1642 </strong> - Born in Lincolnshire, England</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> - Isaac Newton was born (according to the
            Julian calendar, in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25
            December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643[a]) "an hour or two after
            midnight",[7] at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a
            hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac
            Newton, had died three months before.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1659</strong> - He was removed from school and returned to
            Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for
            the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he
            hated.[12] Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his
            mother to send him back to school.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1661</strong> - he was admitted to Trinity College,
            Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough,
            who had studied there. He started as a subsizar—paying his way by
            performing valet's duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in
            1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his MA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1667</strong> - he returned to Cambridge and in October was
            elected as a fellow of Trinity.
          </li>
        </ul>
